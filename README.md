## Trimester-2: JAVA PROGRAMMING

### LAB-1
#### Program-1: Credit Card Validator - This Java code defines a CreditCard class that validates a credit card number using a simple checksum algorithm. It reverses the digits (excluding the last one), applies a transformation, and checks if the checksum matches the last digit of the card. The program displays whether the card number is valid or invalid based on this verification.

#### Program-2: Alphabet War Game - This Java code defines an AlphabetWar class that calculates the winning side in a word battle based on letter strengths. Each side (left and right) has specific letters with assigned strengths, and users can either play with default strengths or customize them. The program compares scores for each side's word(s) and announces the winner or a tie.

### LAB-2
#### Program-1: Top K Frequent Numbers - This Java program, FrequentKNumbers, finds the top K most frequent numbers in an integer array. Users input the array elements and the value of K, and the program outputs the K numbers sorted by frequency, with ties broken by value. It efficiently counts frequencies and sorts them to display the result.

#### Program-2: Share Trader - The ShareTrader Java program calculates the maximum profit from at most two stock transactions, given an array of stock prices. It uses dynamic programming to compute the best profit for each transaction and combines them to find the optimal result. Users input stock prices, and the program outputs the highest achievable profit.

### LAB-3
#### Program-1: Employee Payroll System - This Java program, PayrollSystem, models a payroll system supporting different employee types: HourlyEmployee, SalariedEmployee, and ExecutiveEmployee. The base Employee class defines common attributes and methods, with subclasses overriding methods to calculate weekly salary and bonus according to their payment structure. HourlyEmployee calculates weekly salary based on hourly rate and hours worked, while SalariedEmployee and ExecutiveEmployee calculate it from a monthly salary, with extra bonus rules for executives. The program prompts the user to input hourly employee data and displays their details with calculated salary and bonus.

#### Program-2: Payroll System Test - This Java program, PayrollSystemTest, simulates an employee payroll management system that calculates and displays payroll details for various employee types: HourlyEmployee, SalariedEmployee, and ExecutiveEmployee. The program allows users to input employee details such as ID, name, designation, and salary-related data based on the employee type. It calculates weekly salary, bonus, and annual earnings for each employee and displays their information. Additionally, it computes the total payroll by summing up annual earnings for all employees, showcasing a streamlined payroll management solution.
